You can using such command like this <code>php bin/magento ca:cl</code> to clean the cache or
Using such command <code>bin/magento setup:di:compile</code> to compile or regenerate your modules.
Sometime remove the contents of actual cache folders such as <code>MagentoRoot/var/cache/</code> | <code>MagentoRoot/var/page_cache/</code> | <code>MagentoRoot/generated/code</code> is helping too
